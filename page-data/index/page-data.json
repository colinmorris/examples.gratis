As someone who has lots of queries like \"tar examples\", \"bash for loop\", or \"python super init syntax\" in their search history, I've usually been unsatisfied with what I find. The top results are typically some combination of tutorials, official in-depth documentation, or hyper-specific StackOverflow questions which a bunch of extraneous detail, when what I really want is that <strong>one salient example</strong> that will jog my memory.</p>\n<p>The current state of the site is essentially a proof-of-concept, with just a handful of pages, mostly related to unix shell commands. I'm curious to see whether these pages will spontaneously start attracting any traffice if I just put them out into the universe. If they do, I'll be happy to put in some more time developing the design and content of the site. If not, then <em>tant pis</em>.</p>\n<p>This project <a href=\"https://github.com/colinmorris/examples.gratis\">lives here on GitHub</a>.
