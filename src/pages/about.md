This site is intended to provide brief, simple programming examples to serve as a reminder of how to use a certain command, function, or piece of syntax. As someone who has lots of queries like "tar examples", "bash for loop", or "python super init syntax" in their search history, I've usually been unsatisfied with what I find. The top results are typically some combination of tutorials, official in-depth documentation, or hyper-specific StackOverflow questions which a bunch of extraneous detail, when what I really want is that **one salient example** that will jog my memory.

The current state of the site is essentially a proof-of-concept, with just a handful of pages, mostly related to unix shell commands. I'm curious to see whether these pages will spontaneously start attracting any traffice if I just put them out into the universe. If they do, I'll be happy to put in some more time developing the design and content of the site. If not, then *tant pis*.
